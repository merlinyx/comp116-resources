# ShapingHelper & KnittingHelper API Reference

This document covers the public methods available in `shaping_helper.py` and `knitting_helper.py` for your final project. All shaping operations (tubular knitting, increases, decreases, short rows) live in `ShapingHelper`, which inherits flat-knitting utilities from `KnittingHelper`, which in turn inherits low-level knitout instruction methods from `KnitoutWriter`.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from shaping_helper import ShapingHelper

# Tubular (half-gauge tube):
sh = ShapingHelper(width=20, is_tubular=True)
sh.standard_headers()
sh.cast_on_all_needle_transition(carrier=3, settling_rows=4)
for _ in range(30):
    sh.knit_tubular_row(carrier=3)
sh.bind_off_tubular(carrier=3)
sh.write("my_tube.k")

# Flat:
sh = ShapingHelper(width=20, is_tubular=False)
sh.standard_headers()
sh.cast_on_flat(carrier=1)
for _ in range(20):
    sh.knit_flat_row(carrier=1)
sh.simple_bind_off("f", 1)
sh.write("my_flat.k")
```

---

## Construction

### `ShapingHelper(width, is_tubular=True)`

Creates a new shaping helper instance.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `width` | int | Number of logical stitches (minimum 4 for tubular, 2 for flat) |
| `is_tubular` | bool | `True` for half-gauge tubular knitting, `False` for flat |

**Key state tracked automatically:**

- `self.min_n` / `self.max_n` — current leftmost/rightmost logical needle indices (start at 1 and `width`)
- `self.width` — current stitch count (`max_n - min_n + 1`), updates as you increase/decrease
- `self.direction[carrier]` — current knitting direction for each carrier (`"+"` or `"-"`)

---

## Cast-On Methods

### `cast_on_all_needle_transition(carrier, settling_rows=4)`

**Mode:** Tubular only

Recommended tubular cast-on. Casts on at full gauge on the front bed, knits settling rows, then transfers odd-position stitches to the back bed at rack 0 to reach half-gauge layout. Avoids racking during the cast-on stage.

After this call, the carrier direction is `"-"` and the fabric is ready for `knit_tubular_row()`.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier number |
| `settling_rows` | int | Rows before transitioning (default 4, forced even) |

### `cast_on_flat(carrier)`

**Mode:** Flat only

Alternating-tuck cast-on on the front bed. Handles `inhook`/`releasehook` automatically. After this call, the carrier direction is `"-"`.

---

## Row Knitting

### `knit_tubular_row(carrier)`

**Mode:** Tubular only

Knits one full tubular row (front pass + back pass). Automatically respects and maintains the carrier's current direction.

**Direction behavior:** The direction does NOT flip after a tubular row. If direction is `"-"`, it knits front right-to-left then back left-to-right, and direction stays `"-"` for the next call. This is by design (follows J-30.js convention).

### `knit_flat_row(carrier)`

**Mode:** Flat only

Knits one flat row on the front bed. Direction flips after each call (`"-"` becomes `"+"` and vice versa).

### `knit_body_row(carrier)`

Convenience method: calls `knit_tubular_row` or `knit_flat_row` depending on mode.

---

## Shaping: Increase

### `increase(positions, carrier, lean="right")`

Increases by one or more stitches in a single row. **This method knits a row with the increases embedded** — do NOT call `knit_tubular_row` or `knit_flat_row` separately for this row.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `positions` | int or list of ints | Logical needle index(es) where new stitches appear |
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier to use |
| `lean` | `"right"` or `"left"` | Direction stitches shift to make room |

**Direction requirement:** Carrier direction MUST be `"-"` when calling this method.

**After the call:**

- **Flat:** direction becomes `"+"`. Call `knit_flat_row(carrier)` to get back to `"-"` for the next increase.
- **Tubular:** direction stays `"-"`. You can call another increase immediately, or knit a settling row.

**How lean works:**

- `lean="right"`: Stitches from `p..max_n` shift rightward, opening a gap at each position. `max_n` grows by the number of positions.
- `lean="left"`: Stitches from `min_n..p` shift leftward, opening a gap at each position. `min_n` shrinks by the number of positions.

**Mechanics (both flat and tubular):** Uses a lace.js-style transfer strategy — all stitches move to the back bed first, then return to the front at their new (shifted) positions. A twisted tuck (`miss -`, `tuck +`, `miss -`) anchors a new loop at each empty needle during the knit row. No splits are used.

**Practical notes:** For tubular, avoid more than 1 increase per side per row — large racking values needed for multi-position half-gauge transfers can cause dropped stitches. Single increases per row are reliable. For flat, multi-position increases (2 at a time) work well.

**Example — increase 2 at a time:**

```python
# Flat: increase 2 stitches on the right side
sh.increase(positions=[sh.max_n - 2, sh.max_n], carrier=1, lean="right")
sh.knit_flat_row(carrier=1)  # settling row, direction back to "-"

# Tubular: increase 1 stitch
sh.increase(positions=3, carrier=3, lean="right")
sh.knit_tubular_row(carrier=3)  # optional settling row
```

---

## Shaping: Decrease

### `decrease(position, lean="left")`

Decreases by one stitch at the given position. **This is a pure transfer operation — no carrier is needed.** The caller must knit a settling row afterward.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `position` | int | Logical needle index where stitches merge |
| `lean` | `"left"` or `"right"` | Which side's stitches shift inward |

**No direction requirement.** Decrease is purely mechanical (transfers only).

- `lean="left"`: Shifts `min_n..position-1` rightward, stacking onto `position`. `min_n` increases by 1.
- `lean="right"`: Shifts `position+1..max_n` leftward, stacking onto `position`. `max_n` decreases by 1.

```python
# Decrease on the left edge
sh.decrease(position=sh.min_n + 2, lean="left")
sh.knit_tubular_row(carrier=3)  # settling row

# Decrease on the right edge
sh.decrease(position=sh.max_n - 2, lean="right")
sh.knit_tubular_row(carrier=3)  # settling row
```

### `decrease_both(left_position=None, right_position=None)`

Decreases on both edges in one call. If positions are omitted, defaults to ~25% inset from each edge. Also a pure transfer operation.

```python
sh.decrease_both()  # auto positions
sh.knit_tubular_row(carrier=3)
```

---

## Shaping: Short Rows

### `short_rows(turns, carrier)`

**Mode:** Tubular only

Performs a series of short-row turns on a tube. The carrier walks around the tube knitting each stitch until reaching a turn point, where it tucks and reverses.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `turns` | list of dicts | Each dict has `"b"` (bed: `"f"` or `"b"`) and `"n"` (logical needle index) |
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier to use |

The method automatically finishes the last row and returns the carrier to the starting position `(max_n, "f")`.

```python
sh.short_rows([
    {"b": "b", "n": 8},   # turn on back bed at needle 8
    {"b": "b", "n": 3},   # turn on back bed at needle 3
    {"b": "b", "n": sh.max_n},  # turn at right edge
    {"b": "b", "n": sh.min_n + 1},  # turn near left edge
], carrier=3)
```

### `short_row_flat(work_min, work_max, carrier)`

**Mode:** Flat only

Knits only needles in `[work_min, work_max]`, tucks at the boundary to prevent a hole, then flips direction.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `work_min` | int | Leftmost working needle (absolute index) |
| `work_max` | int | Rightmost working needle (absolute index) |
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier to use |

```python
# Progressive short rows to create a wedge
for inset in range(1, 4):
    sh.short_row_flat(sh.min_n + inset, sh.max_n - inset, carrier=1)
    sh.short_row_flat(sh.min_n + inset, sh.max_n - inset, carrier=1)
```

---

## Bind-Off & Teardown

### `bind_off_tubular(carrier)`

**Mode:** Tubular only

Chain bind-off for tubular fabric (translated from J-30.js). Binds off front bed right-to-left, then back bed left-to-right, with a small security tag. Takes some time to knit.

### `bind_off_flat(carrier)`

**Mode:** Flat only

Stack bind-off on the front bed (delegates to `stack_bind_off`).

### `simple_bind_off(bed, carrier)`

Quick bind-off: knits waste rows, outhooks carrier, drops all stitches.

### `drop_all_tubular(carrier)`

**Mode:** Tubular only

Fast teardown: outhooks the carrier and drops every loop on both beds. Use this during development/testing when you don't need a proper bind-off.

### `bind_off_body(carrier)`

Convenience: calls `bind_off_tubular` or `bind_off_flat` depending on mode.

---

## Direction Management Summary

Understanding carrier direction is critical for authoring patterns with these helpers.

| Method | Direction requirement | Direction after |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `knit_tubular_row` | Any | Unchanged |
| `knit_flat_row` | Any | Flipped |
| `increase` | Must be `"-"` | Flat: `"+"` / Tubular: `"-"` |
| `decrease` | None (no carrier) | Unchanged |
| `short_rows` | Any | Returns to start state |
| `short_row_flat` | Any | Flipped |

**Common pattern for repeated flat increases:**

```python
# After cast-on + even number of rows, direction is "-"
for i in range(3):
    sh.increase(positions=sh.max_n, carrier=1, lean="right")
    # direction is now "+", need to flip back to "-"
    sh.knit_flat_row(carrier=1)  # settling row, direction -> "-"
```

**Common pattern for tubular increases:**

```python
# Direction is "-" (standard for tubular)
sh.increase(positions=5, carrier=3, lean="right")
# direction is still "-", can increase again or knit
sh.knit_tubular_row(carrier=3)  # optional settling
```

---

## Half-Gauge Needle Addressing

For tubular mode, the helper automatically translates logical needle indices to physical positions:

- Front bed: logical needle `n` -> physical `f{2*n}` (even positions)
- Back bed: logical needle `n` -> physical `b{2*n+1}` (odd positions)

You never need to think about this translation when using the high-level methods. It only matters if you're writing custom low-level knitout instructions alongside the helper. In that case, you'd want to use the private method `_loc(bed, n)` to obtain the physical position of that needle.

---

## KnittingHelper Reference (Flat Knitting)

If your project is primarily flat knitting (single bed, no shaping), you can use `KnittingHelper` directly. It provides all the building blocks for flat fabric, texture patterns, and colorwork.

### `KnittingHelper(width)`

Creates a flat knitting helper.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `width` | int | Number of stitches (minimum 2) |

State tracked: `self.min_n` (starts at 1), `self.max_n` (starts at `width`), `self.direction[carrier]` (starts at `"-"` for all carriers).

**Quick start (flat knitting with KnittingHelper directly):**

```python
from knitting_helper import KnittingHelper

kh = KnittingHelper(width=20)
kh.standard_headers()
kh.inhook(1)
kh.cast_on(1)
kh.knit_waste("f", 1)
kh.releasehook(1)

for _ in range(20):
    kh.knit_row("f", 1)

kh.outhook(1)
kh.drop_all("f")
kh.write("my_flat.k")
```

---

### Setup & Headers

#### `standard_headers()`

Adds standard knitout file headers (Position: Center, Width: 450). Call this before any knitting operations.

---

### Cast-On

#### `cast_on(carrier)`

Alternating-tuck cast-on on the front bed. The carrier must already be active (call `self.inhook(carrier)` first). After this call, direction is `"-"`.

**Note:** Unlike `ShapingHelper.cast_on_flat()`, this does NOT handle `inhook`/`releasehook` for you. You manage carrier activation yourself.

```python
kh.inhook(1)
kh.cast_on(1)
kh.knit_waste("f", 1)  # stabilize before releasing
kh.releasehook(1)
```

---

### Row Knitting

#### `knit_row(bed, carrier, op_indices=None)`

Knits one full-width pass on the specified bed, respecting the carrier's current direction, then flips direction.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `bed` | `"f"` or `"b"` | Which bed to knit on |
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier to use |
| `op_indices` | iterable or None | If provided, only knit on these needle indices (default: all needles `min_n..max_n`) |

Direction flips after every call. If direction is `"-"`, knits right-to-left; if `"+"`, knits left-to-right.

```python
kh.knit_row("f", 1)           # full row on front bed
kh.knit_row("b", 1)           # full row on back bed
kh.knit_row("f", 1, op_indices=range(5, 15))  # partial row
```

#### `knit_waste(bed, carrier, waste_rows=10)`

Knits waste/stabilization rows. Always rounds up to an even number so the carrier ends on the same side it started.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `bed` | `"f"` or `"b"` | Which bed to knit on |
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier to use |
| `waste_rows` | int | Number of rows (default 10, forced even) |

---

### Drop & Bind-Off

#### `drop_all(bed="f")`

Drops all stitches on the specified bed from `min_n` through `max_n`.

#### `drop_all_both(margin=0)`

Drops all stitches on both front and back beds. The `margin` parameter extends the drop range beyond `min_n`/`max_n` by that many needles on each side (useful after birdseye which may leave loops on extended needles).

#### `simple_bind_off(bed, carrier)`

Quick bind-off: knits waste rows to push fabric down, outhooks the carrier, then drops all stitches.

```python
kh.simple_bind_off("f", 1)
```

#### `stack_bind_off(carrier, min_n=None, max_n=None)`

Chain-style stack bind-off on the front bed (translated from `rectangle-bindoff.js`). Produces a clean bound edge. The carrier direction will be adjusted automatically if needed.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier to use (must be active) |
| `min_n` | int or None | Leftmost needle (default: `self.min_n`) |
| `max_n` | int or None | Rightmost needle (default: `self.max_n`) |

---

### Texture Patterns (HW2)

#### `knit_kp_rows(rand_array, carrier)`

Knit/purl rows pattern. Each element in the array controls one row: `0` = knit row (front bed), `1` = purl row (back bed). Transfers stitches between beds as needed.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `rand_array` | list of 0/1 | One entry per row |
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier (must be active) |

```python
import random
pattern = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(20)]
kh.knit_kp_rows(pattern, 1)
```

#### `knit_kp_cols(rand_array, carrier, height=20)`

Knit/purl columns pattern. Each element controls one column: `0` = knit (front), `1` = purl (back). The pattern repeats for `height` rows.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `rand_array` | list of 0/1 | One entry per column (length must equal `width`) |
| `carrier` | int | Yarn carrier (must be active) |
| `height` | int | Number of pattern rows (default 20) |

```python
cols = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(20)]
kh.knit_kp_cols(cols, 1, height=30)
```

#### `knit_color_stripes(rand_array, carrier_a, carrier_b)`

Color stripe rows. Each element controls which carrier knits that row: `0` = `carrier_a`, `1` = `carrier_b`. Both carriers must already be active.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `rand_array` | list of 0/1 | One entry per row |
| `carrier_a` | int | First carrier (for 0 values) |
| `carrier_b` | int | Second carrier (for 1 values) |

```python
kh.inhook(2)
kh.knit_row("f", 2)
kh.releasehook(2)
stripes = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(20)]
kh.knit_color_stripes(stripes, 1, 2)
```

---

### Stranded Colorwork (HW3)

#### `prep_stranded_colorwork(pattern)`

Prepares for colorwork: inhooks all carriers found in the pattern, casts on with the first carrier, and knits waste. Call this instead of doing manual cast-on when using colorwork.

#### `knit_stranded_colorwork(pattern)`

Knits a colorwork section on the front bed. Each cell in the 2D pattern array specifies which carrier knits that stitch. Unused carriers float on the back. The pattern is knitted bottom-to-top (last row in the array = first row knitted).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | 2D list of ints | Shape `(rows, width)`, each value is a carrier number |

All carriers referenced must already be active.

```python
# 3-color pattern, 10 rows x 20 columns
pattern = [[random.choice([1, 2, 3]) for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(10)]
kh.prep_stranded_colorwork(pattern)
kh.knit_stranded_colorwork(pattern)
kh.end_stranded_colorwork(pattern)
```

#### `end_stranded_colorwork(pattern)`

Finishes colorwork: outhooks non-primary carriers, knits waste with the primary carrier, outhooks, drops.

---

### Birdseye Jacquard (HW4)

#### `doubleknit_cast_on(carriers)`

Double-knit cast-on for birdseye jacquard. Inhooks all carriers and performs the interlocking front/back cast-on.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `carriers` | list of ints | Sorted list of carrier numbers (e.g., `[1, 2]`) |

#### `knit_birdseye(pattern)`

Knits a birdseye colorwork section using both front and back beds. The front bed shows the design (each cell = which carrier), and the back bed gets a rotating birdseye interlocking pattern automatically.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | 2D list of ints | Shape `(rows, width)`, each value is a carrier number. Requires at least 2 distinct carriers. |

All carriers must already be active. Sets rack to 0.25 during the section.

```python
# Checkerboard with 2 carriers
pattern = [[(1 if (r + c) % 2 == 0 else 2) for c in range(20)] for r in range(10)]
kh.doubleknit_cast_on([1, 2])
kh.knit_birdseye(pattern)
kh.doubleknit_bind_off([1, 2])
```

#### `doubleknit_bind_off(carriers)`

Bind-off for birdseye/double-knit fabric. Outhooks all carriers except the last, transfers back to front, knits settling rows, then drops.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `carriers` | list of ints | Sorted list of carrier numbers |

---

### Carrier Lifecycle (Inherited from KnitoutWriter)

These low-level methods manage yarn carriers. When using `KnittingHelper` directly (not `ShapingHelper`), you're responsible for calling these yourself.

| Method | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `inhook(carrier)` | Bring carrier into action using the inserting hook |
| `releasehook(carrier)` | Release the inserting hook (call after a few rows stabilize the yarn) |
| `outhook(carrier)` | Take carrier out of action |

**Typical carrier lifecycle:**

```python
kh.inhook(1)          # bring yarn in
kh.cast_on(1)         # cast on (yarn gets anchored)
kh.knit_waste("f", 1) # knit a few rows to stabilize
kh.releasehook(1)     # safe to release the hook now
# ... knit your pattern ...
kh.outhook(1)         # done with this carrier
kh.drop_all("f")      # drop the loops
```

---

## Writing Output

### `write(filename=None)`

Generates the knitout string. If `filename` is provided, also writes to that file. Always returns the knitout string. This is common to both helpers.

```python
output = kh.write("my_pattern.k")
print(f"Generated {len(output.splitlines())} lines")
```
